# Event reference

nexMap4 publishes canonical, lowercase, dot-delimited `nexmap4.*` topics through
the required Nexus **EventStream** host contract. This is the public event
surface for other packages and scripts. nexMap4 does **not** emit nexMap3-style
flat names such as `nexMapRoomChanged` or `nexMapPathingComplete`.

## Subscribing

Register a listener through the host `eventStream`:

```js
eventStream.registerEvent("nexmap4.pathing.start", (payload) => {
  console.log(payload.sourceId, payload.targetId, payload.executionMode);
});
```

Payloads are JSON-serializable plain objects. Each event carries the fields
listed below.

## Public topics

| Topic | Payload | Raised when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `nexmap4.room.changed` | `{ roomId, rawTopic, source, sequence, timestampMs }` | The adapter publishes the coalesced current-room event. |
| `nexmap4.room.changed.<id>` | Same as `nexmap4.room.changed` (`<id>` is the numeric room id). | Immediately after `nexmap4.room.changed`, scoped to a specific room. |
| `nexmap4.area.changed` | `{ currentArea, roomId }` | The current GMCP area name changes (after the room events). |
| `nexmap4.pathing.start` | `{ sourceId, targetId, executionMode, segmentCount, totalWeight }` | The Stepper accepts a new planned path. |
| `nexmap4.pathing.complete` | `{ sourceId, targetId, finalRoomId }` | The Stepper reaches the destination. |
| `nexmap4.pathing.blocked` | `{ sourceId, targetId, segmentIndex, reason, error? }` | Path execution cannot continue. |
| `nexmap4.script.start` | `{ scriptId, category, sourceRoomId, targetRoomId, segmentIndex, commandsSent, triggerCondition, travelClasses, destinationId }` | Before a scripted-exit segment's commands are sent. |
| `nexmap4.script.fired` | Script payload plus `{ detail }`. | The script's trigger condition is satisfied. |
| `nexmap4.script.timeout` | Script payload plus `{ detail: { durationMs } }`. | The script reaches its `durationMs` ceiling. |
| `nexmap4.bootstrap.phase` | `{ phase, attempts, ready, completed }` | A startup phase transition (after the host adapter exists). |

### Scoped room events

`nexmap4.room.changed.<id>` lets a listener watch one specific room without
filtering the global stream. It carries the same payload as the unscoped event
and fires immediately after it.

## Ordering

For a `Room.Info` followed by a prompt boundary, the observable order is:

1. `nexmap4.room.changed`
2. `nexmap4.room.changed.<id>`
3. `nexmap4.area.changed` (only when the area actually changed)

Outbound room lifecycle events are emitted only after nexMap4 has published its
coalesced native GMCP event internally, so a listener always sees a settled
room model.

## Events vs. state

An event payload explains a *transition*; [`nexMap.state`](./state.md) provides
the current *snapshot*. Integrations that need the full current model should use
the event as a signal and then re-read the appropriate state branch:

```js
eventStream.registerEvent("nexmap4.room.changed", () => {
  const { location } = nexMap.state; // fresh, frozen snapshot
});
```

## Internal runtime EventBus

Internally, nexMap4 also routes host-sourced events and application intents
through a single in-process EventBus so consumers (the Stepper, renderer, and
notices layer) never hold a direct adapter reference. This bus uses short topic
names (`room.changed`, `walker.complete`, `pathing.blocked`, `intent.sendCommands`,
…) and is a runtime implementation detail — it is **not** exposed on the public
`nexMap` global and is not the EventStream surface above. Build integrations
against the `nexmap4.*` EventStream topics, not the internal bus.
