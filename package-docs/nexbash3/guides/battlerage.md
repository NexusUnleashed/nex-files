# Battlerage

Battlerage is a second, parallel decision track. Where the primary lane fires on
each game prompt, the battlerage lane fires when your rage changes — and it uses
the same first-valid selection over an ordered lane gated by pure `canExecute`
checks (see [the decision model](./decision-model.md)).

## The rage lane

A class's `battlerage` lane is an ordered list of **Rage** actions. A Rage is an
Action with extra metadata:

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `rage` | The rage cost to use it. |
| `cd` | Cooldown in seconds. |
| `balance` | Whether it consumes battlerage balance. |
| `affliction` | The affliction it applies, if any. |
| `combo` | Afflictions that must be present for a combo rage. |
| `raze` | Whether it strips a shield. |
| `coupling` | When it fires relative to the attack: `preAttack` or `auto`. |

Edit the lane in the [Class Configuration](./configuration/class-configuration.md)
tab's **Battlerages** sub-tab. Classes without a battlerage lane simply omit that
sub-tab.

## Reserves (buffers)

You don't want nexBash to dump all your rage on minor damage and then be unable to
raze a shield. The three **reserves** keep rage in hand for the things that matter.
Set them on the [Options tab](./configuration/options.md):

| Reserve | Default | Keeps rage for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Shield Buffer | 17 | A shield raze. |
| CC Buffer | 35 | A crowd-control rage. |
| General Buffer | 48 | General battlerage. |

A reserve is a floor, not a cost: a rage in a category is only allowed to spend
while your rage is above the matching reserve. These are read by the rage gates
through `ctx.battlerage.{shieldBuffer, ccBuffer, generalBuffer}`.

## Live battlerage state

Beyond the reserves, the rage gates read live flags each tick via
`ctx.battlerage`:

| Fact | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `balance` | You are on battlerage balance (ready to use a balance-consuming rage). |
| `freerage` | The free-rage defence is up — rage ignores cost and reserves. |
| `matic` | Automatic curing is active — battlerage is suppressed. |
| `razeReady` | A battlerage raze is legal right now (so the balance-raze stands down). |

nexBash keeps these current by reading the game's own recovery lines and GMCP.
Recovery text like *"You can use another Battlerage ability again…"* is folded
into the owned battlerage state through the
[`observe` boundary](../reference/api.md#apiobserve), and each named ability's
individual cooldown is tracked the same way.

## Coupling: when a rage fires

A rage's `coupling` decides its timing:

- **`preAttack`** — fires *before* the attack on the same prompt. Razes and the
  sensitivity opener use this so the attack lands into the new state.
- **`auto`** — fires autonomously on a rage/freerage change, independent of the
  attack.

## Rage and razing shields

When a target raises a shield, nexBash can break it in two ways: wait it out, or
spend rage to raze. The **Use rage to raze** option
([Options](./configuration/options.md)) enables the rage path, gated by the Shield
Buffer so it won't starve a more important rage. If a battlerage raze is queued,
the balance-raze path stands down (`ctx.battlerage.razeReady`) so the shield isn't
double-handled. Pair this with the **Swap on shield** option and per-NPC
**Can Shield** / **Can Raze** flags to control shield behavior precisely.

## Inspecting battlerage

```js
nexBash.state.battlerage;
// { balance, shieldBuffer, ccBuffer, generalBuffer }

nexBash.debug();
// logs each battlerage candidate with its rage cost, availability, and balance
```
