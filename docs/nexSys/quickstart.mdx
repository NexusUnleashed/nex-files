title: Quickstart

## 1. Install dependencies

Install [eventStream](../eventStream/introduction.mdx) first, then install nexSys.

## 2. Open the configuration dialog

If the dialog does not open automatically, run this in the command line:

```js
ns config;
```

<!-- TODO: Add a screenshot of the config dialog. -->

## 3. Set your command separator

Set a separator that you do not use for normal commands. Most players use `|`.

- Example: `|`
- Avoid: `;` if you use it for alias syntax

## 4. Confirm curing settings

- Select **Transmutation** or **Concoctions** to match your curing method.
- Set sip and moss thresholds.
- Enable or disable focus and tree based on your preferences.

## 5. Configure defences and aff priorities

- Use the **Defence Priorities** tab to define keepup and static defences.
- Use the **Curing Priorities** tab to reorder afflictions.

## 6. Save and sync

Click **Save** to persist settings and sync with the serverside curing system.

If you want to force a reload later:

```text
ns load
```

## 7. Validate

- Confirm `nexSys.sys.settings.sep` is set.
- Run `nexSys.sys.isPaused()` to confirm system state.
- Look for `SystemLoaded` events in the eventStream log if you have logging enabled.
