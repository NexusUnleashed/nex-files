nexSys is a full featured combat systems package for the Nexus client. It provides event driven state tracking, server side curing orchestration, configurable priorities, queue management, and a configurable UI for advanced players who want a modern, maintainable combat stack.

## What you get

- Serverside curing management with dynamic priority updates for afflictions and defences.
- A unified event model on top of GMCP and Nexus events (via eventStream).
- A configurable prompt overlay with affliction abbreviations and colored vitals.
- Queue helpers for class, free, and specialized queues.
- Utility APIs for common client tasks (sending commands, line replacements, tab completion).
- Built in config dialog with system, curing, defence, precache, and color tabs.

## Requirements

- Nexus web client (official).
- eventStream (required dependency).

## Architecture overview

nexSys exposes a global `nexSys` object and wires itself to GMCP and Nexus events. It maintains internal models for afflictions, defences, balances, caches, and trackables, then emits its own high level events that other packages can subscribe to.

Key modules:

- `base/affs`, `base/defs`, `base/balances`: State models and priority logic.
- `base/system`: Startup, server side sync, and output scheduling.
- `base/queues`: Multi queue support and queue helpers.
- `base/clientOverrides`: Prompt and input overrides.
- `components`: Configuration UI and updater.

## Version

Current package version is defined in the bundle as `nexSys.version` and in the workspace as `2.2.7`.
