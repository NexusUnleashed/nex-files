## Configuration tabs

- **System Settings**: Core toggles, command separator, and curing thresholds.
- **Curing Priorities**: Drag and drop afflictions by priority.
- **Defence Priorities**: Keepup and static defence priorities by class.
- **Precache**: Preferred cache counts for herbs and minerals.
- **Color Settings**: Reserved for future prompt and UI customization.
