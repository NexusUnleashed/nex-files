title: Curing System
---

nexSys is built around the Nexus serverside curing engine. It tracks your state locally and publishes updated priorities and actions back to the server.

## Curing flow

1. GMCP and triggers update afflictions, defences, balances, and trackables.
2. nexSys recalculates priorities and output payloads.
3. Commands are sent with your configured command separator.
4. The server applies curing priorities and executes defences.

## Priority ranges

- `1` to `25` are active priorities.
- `26` is reserved for ignored items in serverside curing.
- `0` means ignore in local priorities (treated as ignored for serverside).

## Output scheduling

nexSys batches output for efficiency:

- Output is chunked to avoid server limits.
- Output pauses while the system is paused or in slow mode.
- Output replays when pending state clears.

Key events:

- `ForcePopulateEvent` to rebuild output immediately.
- `SystemOutputCompleteEvent` to signal completion.

## Server side settings sync

nexSys keeps a local mirror of serverside curing state in `nexSys.serversideSettings`:

- `status` for current curing toggles and thresholds.
- `affs` for affliction priority mappings.
- `defs` for defence priority mappings.

On startup, nexSys runs a sync sequence (curing status, priority list, defence list, rift, time) before resuming output.

## Curing controls

You can use `nexSys.sys.setSystemStatus` or update the config dialog to change curing settings. Changes are mapped to serverside commands through `serversideEvents`.

```js
nexSys.sys.setSystemStatus("sipPriority", "Mana");
```

## Best practices

- Always set a command separator before enabling output.
- Keep batching enabled unless you have a specific reason to disable it.
- Avoid setting priority to `0` for live combat afflictions unless you truly want them ignored.
- Use the priorities UI to keep aff ordering consistent for your class.
