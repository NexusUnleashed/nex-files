## Command separator not set

If nexSys fails to start or prints a startup warning, set `sys.settings.sep` and save in the config dialog. The system will not send output without a separator.

## Custom prompt not showing

- Confirm `nexSys.sys.settings.customPrompt` is `true`.
- Make sure another package is not overriding `nexusclient.buffer().add_block`.

## Output appears stuck

If output does not resume after death or reconnect:

```js
nexusclient.send_commands("echo SystemEvent SystemOutputCompleteEvent");
```

This forces the output scheduler to reset.

## No events firing

Ensure eventStream is installed and loaded before nexSys. You should be able to call `eventStream.registerEvent` without errors.

## Update check fails

The config dialog checks the NPM registry for updates. If your environment blocks network access, the version check will remain unchanged.

## Known quirks

- The `prepend_notice` utility depends on the same helper used by the prompt renderer. If you see errors, update to the latest build.
- The affliction list includes several entries marked as TODO in the source. These are tracked but not fully tuned.
