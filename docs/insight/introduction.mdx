insight is a combat intelligence engine that tracks afflictions, defences, balances, limbs, and target state with probabilistic timelines. It ingests GMCP and skill detection events and exposes a clean API for scripts to query and react to state changes.

<!-- TODO: Add a screenshot or example output snippet from the insight prompt display. -->

## What you get

- Multi target tracking with per target timelines and probabilities.
- Affliction, defence, balance, limb, and stat state models.
- Cure inference and confirmation helpers.
- EventStream integration for high signal events.
- Optional prompt display of active afflictions.

## Requirements

- Nexus web client (official).
- eventStream (required dependency).
- nexAction (required for skill detection events).

Optional integrations:

- nexSys for shared curing and damage signals.
- nexGui for target visualization (limbs, affs).

## Architecture overview

insight creates a Player model for every tracked target. Each player has affs, defs, bals, limbs, stats, and a Timeline that manages probability forks. Skill modules register `insight.<skill>.<ability>` events which feed into timeline updates.

Key modules:

- `base/api`: public API and helpers.
- `base/events`: eventStream wiring and prompt display.
- `base/classes`: Player, Timeline, Affliction, Balance, Limb, Stat.
- `base/factories`: afflictions, defences, balances, cures, limbs, stats.
- `base/skills`: skill specific handlers for detections.

## Version

Current package version is `0.5.4` (see `insight.version`).
