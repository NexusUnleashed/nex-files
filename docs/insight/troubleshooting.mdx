## No events firing

- Confirm eventStream is installed and running.
- Ensure insight is loaded and `insight.registerInsightEvents()` was called.

## Target state not updating

- Run `insight.setTarget("name")` for your current target.
- Confirm GMCP target events are arriving (`IRE.Target.Set`).

## Prompt display not showing

- Set `insight.reporting.promptDisplay = true`.
- Ensure `insight.reporting.shouldShow` is not stuck `false`.

## Skill detections missing

- Make sure nexAction is installed to emit `nexSkillMatch` events.
- Verify your class skill triggers are enabled.

## Cures not resolving affs

- Check the cure table ordering in the reference pages.
- Confirm required balances are not missing.
