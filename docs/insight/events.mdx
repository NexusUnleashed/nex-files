insight emits and consumes eventStream events for afflictions, defences, balances, limbs, and skill detection.

## Emitted events

| Event | Payload | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `insightLoaded` | none | Fired when insight has finished initialization. |
| `insightAffsUpdated` | none | Affliction state updated. |
| `insightGotAff` | Affliction | Any aff added. |

| `insightLimbBreak` | Limb | Limb broken. |
| `insightLimbReset` | Limb | Limb reset. |
| `insightUsedCure` | `{ id, person }` | Cure used. |

## Affliction specific events

These events include the affliction id in the name. Use inline code to avoid MDX parsing issues.

- `insightGotAff{afflictionId}`
- `insightLostAff{afflictionId}`

Example:

```js
eventStream.registerEvent("insightGotAffasthma", (aff) => {
  console.log(`Target gained ${aff.id}`);
});
```

## Defence specific events

- `insightGotDef{defenceId}`
- `insightLostDef{defenceId}`

## Balance specific events

- `insightGotBal{balanceId}`
- `insightLostBal{balanceId}`

## Limb specific events

- `insightLimbHit{limbId}`
- `insightLimbBreak{limbId}`
- `insightLimbReset{limbId}`

## Timer events

Insight timers emit generic timer events used by eventStream:

- `timerReset{timerId}`
- `timerStarted{timerId}`
- `timerStopped{timerId}`

## Skill detection events

When insight processes a skill detection, it emits:

- `insight.<skill>.<ability>`

Example:

```js
eventStream.registerEvent("insight.occultism.instill", (args) => {
  console.log(args);
});
```

## Consumed events

insight listens to:

- `IRE.Target.Set`
- `PromptEvent`
- `nexSkillMatch`
- `nexSkillNpcMatch`

These feed target updates, prompt display, and skill parsing.
