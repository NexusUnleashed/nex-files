# nexGear

`nexGear` is a package for the **Iron Realms Nexus client** that provides a streamlined, interactive way to manage all of your gear in Achaea.  
It integrates directly with the Nexus UI to give you sortable, filterable tables, quick selection controls, and custom set management — all while storing your preferences automatically.

## 🌟 Features

- **Interactive Gear Table**

  - Built on [TanStack React Table](https://tanstack.com/table).
  - Supports sorting, grouping, and filtering by any column.
  - Clean UI that adapts to both light and dark themes.

- **Set Management**

  - Exclusive, radio-style slot selection for each **official set** (Fireplane, Waterplane, etc.).
  - Multi-set assignment ✦ picker for **user-defined custom sets**.
  - Automatic persistence to `window.nexGear.sets`.

- **Trinket Management**

  - Dedicated ✦ picker for trinkets, since they are not tied to a single set.
  - Assign one trinket to multiple sets with a simple checklist.
  - Supports both official and custom sets.

- **Custom Sets**

  - Create new set IDs via a **Manage Sets** popover.
  - Add or delete custom sets on the fly.
  - Immediately available in trinket and gear assignment pickers.

- **Modal Integration**

  - Fully integrated **NexDialog** with draggable/resizable modal.
  - Footer controls:
    - **Manage Sets** (left)
    - **Clear Filters** and **Close** (right)

- **Smart Grouping**

  - When you group by the **Set** column, custom sets appear alongside official ones.
  - Items display under every set they are assigned to.

- **Persistence**
  - All assignments and preferences are stored in `window.nexGear.sets`.
  - Automatically reapplied on reload.

## ⚙️ API & Commands

The `nexGear` package exposes its configuration and state under the global object:

```js
window.nexGear;
```

### Structure

```js
window.nexGear = {
  sets: {
    [setId: string]: {
      head?: itemId,
      hands?: itemId,
      chest?: itemId,
      feet?: itemId,
      trinket?: itemId,
      // ...other slots
    },
    // e.g.
    fireplane: {
      head: 10123,
      feet: 10555,
    },
    BossKiller: {
      chest: 20202,
      trinket: 30001,
    }
  }
}
```

- **Official sets** (e.g., `fireplane`) — enforced “one item per slot”.
- **Custom sets** (e.g., `BossKiller`) — user-defined; gear can come from any set.

### API Usage

- **Assign gear to a slot**

  ```js
  // Assign boots (id 10555) to fireplane feet
  nexGear.sets.fireplane.feet = 10555;
  ```

- **Remove gear from a slot**

  ```js
  delete nexGear.sets.fireplane.feet;
  ```

- **Create a new custom set**

  ```js
  nexGear.sets.MyCustomSet = {};
  ```

- **Assign trinket to multiple sets**

  ```js
  nexGear.sets.fireplane.trinket = 30001;
  nexGear.sets.BossKiller.trinket = 30001;
  ```

- **Delete a custom set**
  ```js
  delete nexGear.sets.BossKiller;
  ```

## 🖱️ UI Interactions

- **Radio button** — select exactly one gear piece per slot per official set.
- **✦ icon button** — open the multi-set assignment picker:
  - For trinkets: lists all sets.
  - For standard gear: lists only custom sets.
- **Manage Sets** — add/remove custom set IDs via footer popover.

## 📌 Notes

- All configuration is stored in the client session (`window.nexGear.sets`).
- If you clear or reset the Nexus client, reloading your package will restore gear handling.
- Custom sets are entirely client-side and won’t conflict with game mechanics.
- Intended for **player convenience only** — it doesn’t change game rules, just how you manage your equipment.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Install `nexGear` from npm/unpkg:

   ```js
   import("https://unpkg.com/nexgear/bundle.min.js");
   ```

2. Open the modal (`nexGear Control Panel`) in Nexus.
3. Add your gear pieces and assign them to sets/trinkets.
4. Optionally create custom sets for your own builds.
5. Save and close — everything persists automatically.
