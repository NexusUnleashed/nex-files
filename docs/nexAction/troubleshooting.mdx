title: Troubleshooting

## Trigger does not fire

- Confirm your line handler calls `nexAction.triggers.process` for every line.
- Check that the trigger is enabled (`enabled` defaults to true).
- If using `fg` or `bg`, confirm the hex colors match the parsed line.
- For regex patterns, verify you escaped punctuation correctly.

## Trigger fires once then disappears

- You may have set `once: true`.
- `duration` removes or disables the trigger after the timeout.
- `prompt: true` removes or disables the trigger on the next prompt.

## Multi-step sequences never complete

- Patterns must match in order with no gaps.
- Use `lines` or `duration` to control how long the sequence stays active.
- If you need a longer window, increase `lines` or `duration`.

## `crypto.randomUUID` is undefined

- This happens in older browsers or restricted environments.
- Provide a UUID polyfill or pass a custom `id` for every trigger.

## Known limitations

- `remove` by RegExp does not match the current reflex format.
- Re-enabling triggers does not fully restore `duration`, `lines`, or `prompt` timers. Remove and re-add if you need fresh timers.
