nexAction is a lightweight trigger and alias engine for the Nexus client. It evaluates incoming lines against fast, gated patterns and fires actions when matches complete, including multi-line sequences.

<!-- TODO: Add a flow diagram of the trigger pipeline (gate -> match -> action -> finalAction). -->

## What you get

- A unified trigger and alias API (`nexAction.triggers` and `nexAction.aliases`).
- Regex, string, and multi-step pattern support.
- Lifecycle controls for once, duration, prompt, and line-limited triggers.
- Tag-based grouping for bulk enable, disable, and removal.
- Optional color matching for foreground and background text.

## Requirements

- Nexus web client (official).
- `crypto.randomUUID` (available in modern browsers).
- eventStream if you use `prompt` actions.

## Architecture overview

`nexAction` exposes two handlers: `triggers` for incoming lines and `aliases` for command or custom text handling. Each handler maintains a `reflexes` list and provides add, remove, enable, disable, and process helpers.

During processing, nexAction:

1. Increments a global line counter (`nexAction.lineCount`).
2. Applies optional color filters.
3. Applies a literal prefix gate (when possible) to avoid unnecessary regex work.
4. Evaluates the active pattern and advances multi-step sequences.
5. Executes actions and handles lifecycle cleanup.

## Version

Current package version is `1.1.7` (see `nexaction3/package.json`).
