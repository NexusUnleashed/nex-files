Nutrition damage is unchanged for now, but I&#39;ll keep an eye on it. 3/6/2025"
    >
      Nausea passive damage reduced pretty significantly. This actually received
      a stealth buff (not by design) when the unblockable damage changes went
      in, so the overcorrection here was a little more significant than I
      anticipated. I&#39;ve increased the tick rate slightly (ten seconds to
      nine), but overall dps is down somewhat and burst is down significantly.
      Nutrition damage is unchanged for now, but I&#39;ll keep an eye on it.{" "}
