# Introduction

The nexSkills package is an passive event package dedicated to player actions. nexSkills is a repository of patterns for player actions. For every action detected a custom event is raised.

## Events

nexSkills raises three events for each matched player action.

`nexSkillMatch`, `nexSkillMatch.{action id}`. and `nexSkillMatch.{action id}.{action type}`

A separate event is raised for npc actions. `nexSkillNpcMatch`

See [examples](./examples.mdx) for examples how now to leverage these events.
