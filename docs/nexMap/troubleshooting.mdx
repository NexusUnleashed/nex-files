title: Troubleshooting
---

## Map does not load

- Run `nm load` manually and wait for the crowdmap download to finish.
- Confirm eventStream is installed and working.
- Check the console for `nexMap invalid API key` messages.

## nexMap tab is missing

- Reload the client after installing the package.
- Open the Nexus map panel and look for the **nexMap** tab.

## Pathing fails or stops

- Check that your travel toggles match your character abilities.
- Ensure `excludeRooms` does not block required rooms.
- Try `nm stop` then `nm goto <roomId>` to reset a route.

## Wormhole errors

- If you see `I cannot fathom the meaning of "worm"`, disable wormholes.
- Serpents should enable **Vibrating Stick** in settings.
- Wormholes are community sourced; a missing wormhole will be removed automatically.

## NPC search returns empty results

- Wait for `nm load` to finish.
- Ensure network access to the nexMap API is allowed.
- The database is community driven; not all NPCs are indexed yet.

## Performance issues

- Disable logging with `nexMap.status.toggleLogging()` if it is enabled.
- Avoid excessive map zoom changes while the map is still loading.
