title: Travel Options
---

nexMap can route through a number of fast travel systems. These are optional and should only be enabled if you own the travel method.

## Travel options

| Option | Toggle | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Wormholes | Use wormholes | Uses stored wormhole edges and `worm warp`. |
| Sewer grates | Use sewer grates | Adds sewer grate exits to the graph. |
| Low clouds | Eagle wings | Uses `duanatharCommand` to enter low clouds. |
| High clouds | Atavian wings | Uses `duanatharanCommand` to enter high clouds. |
| Universe tarot | Use Universe tarot | Jester/Occultist only; adds universe nodes and exits. |
| Macbre Knocker | Macbre Knocker | Adds a knocker door shortcut. |
| Air harness | Air Harness | Adds air harness exits in the Western Isles. |
| Enchanted pebble | Enchanted Pebble | Toggles the Rageteeth &lt;-&gt; Dark Forest shortcut. |
| Gare | Automatic | Dragon only; adds a Gare shortcut. |
| Urn mounts | Automatic | Uses mounted urn exits if `nexSys` reports a valid mount. |
| Flame collars | Automatic | Adds flame paths in Yggdrasil related areas. |

## Travel weights

nexMap assigns weights to travel edges using your **celerity** setting. If your movement speed changes, update `celerity` so route selection stays accurate.

## Wormholes

Wormholes are loaded from the shared wormhole database and can also be discovered in play. nexMap listens for wormhole messages and updates the graph. If a wormhole is missing, nexMap removes it and recalculates the route.

- Serpents can enable **Vibrating Stick** to probe for wormholes.
- Use `nm wormholes` to toggle wormhole routing on or off.

## Cloud travel

Cloud travel is added to any outdoor room in the Main or Meropis continents. Set the command strings in configuration:

- `duanatharCommand` (low clouds)
- `duanatharanCommand` (high clouds)

These commands can be multi-step sequences separated by your command separator.

## Universe tarot

Universe exits are created for Jester and Occultist characters. If you do not meet the class requirement, the toggle has no effect.

## Air harness

Air harness exits are limited to the Western Isles. If you enable the toggle without owning the harness, routing will fail when it attempts to use those edges.
