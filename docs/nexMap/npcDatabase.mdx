title: NPC Database
---

nexMap includes a shared NPC database that tracks denizen sightings and supports quick lookup by name.

## Lookup commands

- `nm npc <string>`: search the denizen database and display results in a table.
- Click any entry in the table to path to the associated room.

## How data is collected

When the map is loaded and GMCP room data is available, nexMap records denizens in the current room and updates their known locations through the shared API. This allows NPC lookups to remain fresh across the community.

## Troubleshooting

If the NPC table is empty:

- Make sure `nm load` completed successfully.
- Verify that network access to the nexMap API is allowed.
- Check the console for API errors.
