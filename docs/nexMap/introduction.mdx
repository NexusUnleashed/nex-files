nexMap is a full featured mapping, navigation, and pathfinding package for the Nexus client. It builds a live map from the Achaea Crowdmap dataset, renders it inside Nexus, and provides fast, configurable routing with support for special travel options like clouds, wormholes, and tarot.

## What you get

- Crowdmap based world map with high performance rendering and room labels.
- Smart pathfinding with travel options (wormholes, clouds, sewer grates, tarot, urns, and more).
- One click routing: click any room to path.
- A configurable UI for travel options, command separator, and pathing speed.
- NPC database lookups and tracking utilities.
- EventStream integration for room, area, and pathing events.

## Requirements

- Nexus web client (official).
- eventStream (required dependency; listed as `nexevent` in package metadata).
- Network access to load the crowdmap data and optional NPC/wormhole services.

## Architecture overview

nexMap loads the crowdmap JSON, builds a Graphology graph for pathfinding, and a Cytoscape graph for display. GMCP and EventStream events drive room changes, while the walker module manages hybrid path tracking and special travel edges. Settings are stored in `nexMapSettings` under Nexus variables.

Key modules:

- `base/graph`: Graph construction, exit conversion, display graph generation.
- `base/walker`: Pathfinding and hybrid path tracking for long routes.
- `base/navigation`: GMCP driven room and area transitions.
- `base/settings`: User preferences and travel toggles.
- `base/wormholes`: Wormhole discovery and routing.
- `base/tracking`: Highlighting and tracking targets, pets, and dopplegangers.

## Version

Current package version is `2.2.5` (see `nexMap.status.version`).
