title: Pathing and Navigation
---

nexMap provides click to path navigation and hybrid routing that combines built in Nexus `path track` with special exits like wormholes and clouds.

## Core pathing flow

1. The map graph is built from Crowdmap data.
2. A Graphology shortest path is calculated between your current room and the destination.
3. The route is converted into a hybrid command list that uses `path track` for long stretches and direct commands for special exits.
4. Each step is sent as your balance allows (via EventStream).

## Common commands

- `nm goto <roomId>`: route to a room number.
- `nm goto <area name>`: route to a matching game area.
- `nm stop`: cancel the current route.
- `nm find <string>`: search for a room name and click to route.
- `nm area <string>`: search for areas and click to route.

## Click to path

Click any room on the map to begin routing. The current room is outlined, and the destination is selected on the map.

## Special exits

Special exits are broken out of `path track` automatically. Examples include:

- Wormholes (`worm warp`)
- Sewer grates (`enter grate`)
- Tarot shortcuts
- Clouds and wings
- Air harness

If a special exit is required, nexMap will send a `path stop` before issuing the command, then resume path tracking.

## Pathing limits

- The Nexus `path track` command cannot exceed ~100 steps. nexMap segments long routes to stay within the limit.
- If your routing settings exclude a critical room, the path may fail. Check `excludeRooms` and travel toggles.

## Logging

Enable internal logging with:

```js
nexMap.status.toggleLogging();
```

This adds timing and route diagnostics to the console.
